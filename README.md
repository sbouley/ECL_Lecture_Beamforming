# ECL Lecture Beamforming

This repositery involves a PDF presentation of a microphones array techniques / beamforming lecture given at Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon (France) for the [Master of Science in Acoustics](https://master-acoustics.ec-lyon.fr/index.php) as well as an additional practical lab.

Advanced acoustics / ECL-MoD 7.3 : Acoustic sources and propagation / Sound Source Localization - Beamforming

The Jupyter Notebook is a practical lab aiming at describing the expected performances of both a 1D-linear and 2D-planar arrays for the sound source localization with a conventional beamforming, in terms of resolution, dynamics and spatial aliasing.


## To run the Jupyter Notebook

The Notebook must be run with either a JupyterLab or a classic Jupyter Notebook. Please visit [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/) to install one of them. Note that Jupyter in installed by default with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

If you want cloud-based service without installation, you can try [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).
