# ECL Lecture Beamforming

This Jupyter Notebook is a practical lab included in the beamforming lecture at Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon (France) for the [Master of Science in Acoustics](https://master-acoustics.ec-lyon.fr/index.php)

Advanced acoustics / ECL-MoD 7.3 : Acoustic sources and propagation / Sound Source Localization - Beamforming

It aims at describing the expected performances of both a 1D-linear and 2D-planar arrays for the sound source localization with a conventional beamforming, in terms of resolution, dynamics and spatial aliasing.
